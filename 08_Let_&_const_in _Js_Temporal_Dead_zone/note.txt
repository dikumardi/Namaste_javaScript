                /** Temporal Dead Zone  **/

let and const  both are hoisted but they are different from var they go in a temporal dead zone jab tak variable ko value nahi de deta tab tak


In let we cannot do like create same variable name again and again it gives us syntax error but in case of var we can do it it cannot give error

for const we have to give value to  it at time of creating a variable if not it will give syntax error  but agar hum const ko naya value dete hai with same name to wo type error hota hai

Temporal Dead zone is tab hota hai jab ki let and const hoisted hota hai us bich ka samai jab tak variable initialization nahi hota hai



                /** let and const **/
let and const are hoisted but not initialized like var.
They are in a Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) until they are initialized.
Accessing them before declaration causes a ReferenceError.

let and const cannot be redeclared in the same scope → SyntaxError.
const must be initialized when declared → TypeError if not.

/** Temporal Dead Zone **/
TDZ is the time between hoisting and initialization of let/const.
Variables in TDZ cannot be accessed and throw ReferenceError.

/** Errors **/
ReferenceError → Access before declaration or undeclared variable.
SyntaxError → Invalid syntax (e.g., redeclaration of let/const).
TypeError → Wrong type or behavior (e.g., uninitialized const).
