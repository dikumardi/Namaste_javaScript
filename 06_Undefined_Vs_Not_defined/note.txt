undefined is happen e variable is declared but no value is assigned given a value to the variable so when GEC is create in the first pphase a memory allocation is done  and at that time vartiable is assigned undefined to it it is like a placeholder where we can put value to it when it is initilize 

not defined means variable is never declared and if if search for it it will find error as reference error
loosely type or weakly typed means we can change  the datatype anytime and no error can be found
eg var a ;
a =10 ;
a ='hello'


/** What is undefined?
undefined means the variable has been declared but no value is assigned yet.

It happens during the first phase of the Global Execution Context (GEC), also known as the Memory Creation Phase.

In this phase, JavaScript allocates memory for all variables and assigns them the value undefined.

You can think of undefined as a placeholder — the variable exists, but no value has been given yet. **/

What is Loosely Typed / Weakly Typed Language?
JavaScript is called a loosely typed or weakly typed language.

This means you can change the type of a variable at any time, and JavaScript won’t give an error.
