Everything in javascript happens inside an "Execution Context"

Execution Context = we can assume this Execution Context to be a big box or a container

It has two componetnt in it first component is memory component 

 memory component- so this is the place where all the variables and functions are stored as key -value  pair . 
 
 and Memory component is also know as variable environment 
 
 The second component of this Execution Context is the code component.
 
 code component  this is the place where code is executed  one line at a time code component is also know as  thread of Execution so this thread of execution is like a thread in which  the whole code  is execued one line at a time

javascript is a synchronous single-threaded language single threaded mean javascript can only executed one command at a time and in speficic order
